A Ferranti Sirius emulator on Unity

This is a Ferranti Sirius emulator on Unity. 

Sirius is a (relatively) small computer from UK company Ferranti, announced in 1959. 
Its programs and outputs were punched on paper tapes, just like the earliest "automatic computers." 
It was not a fast computer, but its cost was low, and it also came with a (slightly) high-level language called Autocode.

Especially, the third link contains a logic-level simulator of Sirius, programming documents and programs. 

This emulator lets you experience what it is like to program a computer with paper tapes.
